# Burst Computing Concepts

## FaaS Limitations
- Worker isolation
- No group awareness (no simultaneity guarantee)
- Fragmented orchestration
- Heavy remote data movement

## Burst Computing
- Group invocation: flare
- Burst size
- Worker packing and granularity
- Locality-aware execution

## Why It Matters
Burst enables synchronous coordination patterns (MPI-like) for distributed algorithms.
